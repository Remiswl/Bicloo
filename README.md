# Bicloo - Bicycle sharing system
Developed using an MVC framework (framework designed by 3W Academy, based on __Symfony 4.4__), the restaurant's website allows registered users to book a table and order dishes.

The site was made during my training at the 3W Academy.

The objectives of the exercise were to:
1. Use APIs (here that of JC Decaux) in order to display in real time the number of places available at a Bicloo station (bicyle sharing system of the French city of Nantes)
2. Generate a map (here thanks to __Leaflet__) and display the location of a Bicloo station.

## Technologies
* __JavaScript ES6__
* __jQuery__
* API: __Leaflet__
* Mapping: __Mapbox__, __OpenStreetMap__

## Launch
To launch the site, open 'index.php'.

To run the site, enter:
1. a JCDecaux' access key in 'display_data.js', line 20.
2. a Mapbox' accessToken in 'display_data.js', line 85.

## Comments
* the website is responsive 
* it is conform to the W3C standards
* comments are in French
